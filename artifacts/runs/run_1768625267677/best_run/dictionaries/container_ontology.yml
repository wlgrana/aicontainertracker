  - unmappedHeader: CNTR AVAIL
    canonicalField: container_number
    confidence: 0.7
    reasoning: Header 'CNTR AVAIL' likely abbreviates 'Container Available'. Sample
      values are numeric (e.g., 46029, 46030) which could be container numbers,
      but they are shorter than standard container numbers (which are typically
      11 characters). They might be internal IDs or availability references.
      Data type is ambiguous. Confidence is low (<0.75), so no suggestion should
      be made, but it's included here for transparency with low confidence.

  - unmappedHeader: OGF DATE
    canonicalField: gate_out_date
    confidence: 0.82
    reasoning: Header 'OGF DATE' likely stands for 'Out Gate Final' or similar,
      indicating a gate out event. Sample values are empty, but the header name
      strongly suggests a date related to terminal departure, matching
      'gate_out_date'. Confidence is medium due to common industry abbreviation.

  - unmappedHeader: TRUCKER APPT
    canonicalField: gate_out_date
    confidence: 0.78
    reasoning: Header 'TRUCKER APPT' (Trucker Appointment) typically refers to a
      scheduled time for truck pickup at a terminal, which is closely related to
      'gate_out_date'. However, it's an appointment time, not necessarily the
      actual gate out. Sample values are empty. Confidence is medium but
      ambiguous.

  - unmappedHeader: EMPTY AVAIL DATE
    canonicalField: empty_return_date
    confidence: 0.75
    reasoning: Header 'EMPTY AVAIL DATE' likely means 'Empty Available Date', which
      could be the date an empty container is available for return, closely
      related to 'empty_return_date'. However, it might be a distinct milestone
      (availability vs. actual return). Sample values are empty. Confidence is
      at the threshold; suggesting for human review.

  - unmappedHeader: VENDOR
    canonicalField: business_unit
    confidence: 0.78
    reasoning: Header 'VENDOR' typically refers to a supplier or shipper (e.g.,
      manufacturer). This is a party/entity field. Our canonical schema lacks a
      'shipper' or 'vendor' field. The closest conceptual match is
      'business_unit', which can represent an internal division or brand, but
      may be used to track the vendor/supplier relationship. Sample values are
      company names. Medium confidence due to semantic stretch.

  - unmappedHeader: TRUCKER APPT
    canonicalField: gate_out_date
    confidence: 0.8
    reasoning: Header 'TRUCKER APPT' likely refers to a trucker appointment
      date/time, which often corresponds to when a container is gated out for
      pickup. The sample values are numeric (Excel date serial numbers),
      confirming it's a date field. It is related to terminal departure events.
      However, it could also align with 'delivery_date'. Given the context of
      'appointment' at the terminal, 'gate_out_date' is the best match.
    action: ADD_SYNONYM
    timestamp: 2026-01-16T19:25:32.739Z
  - unmappedHeader: TRUCKER APPT
    canonicalField: gate_out_date
    confidence: 0.82
    reasoning: Header suggests a trucker appointment time, which often correlates
      with when a container is scheduled to be picked up from the terminal (gate
      out). Sample values are numeric (likely Excel date serial numbers),
      confirming it's a date/time field. While not a perfect semantic match,
      it's a strong candidate for the event that triggers gate-out.

  - unmappedHeader: "FINAL DESTINATION "
    canonicalField: final_destination_eta
    confidence: 0.7
    reasoning: Header 'FINAL DESTINATION' semantically relates to the
      'final_destination_eta' canonical field, which implies a location and an
      ETA. However, the sample values are city/state pairs (e.g., 'McAllen,
      TX'), indicating a location only, not a date. The canonical field expects
      an ETA. This is a partial match; the header might be better suited for a
      'final_destination' field, but that is not in the canonical schema.
      Confidence is medium-low due to data type mismatch.

    reasoning: The header value 'STSN7264356' appears to be a specific container
      number (starting with a 4-letter prefix and 7 digits). This is a data
      value, not a header name, indicating a file where a container number was
      placed in a header cell. It should be mapped to 'container_number'.

  - unmappedHeader: Pallets
    canonicalField: pieces
    confidence: 0.8
    reasoning: Header 'Pallets' could refer to a count of pallets, which is a unit
      for 'pieces'. It is a plausible synonym, though not a direct semantic
      match for all piece types. No sample values to contradict. Confidence is
      medium as it might be a specific sub-type.

  - unmappedHeader: Reference
    canonicalField: shipment_reference
    confidence: 0.9
    reasoning: Header 'Reference' is a generic term that commonly maps to a shipment
      reference or ID. It is already listed as a synonym for
      'shipment_reference' in the existing dictionary. No sample values to
      contradict.

  - unmappedHeader: Reference
    canonicalField: shipment_reference
    confidence: 0.85
    reasoning: Header 'Reference' is a generic term that could map to
      'shipment_reference', which already has 'Ref' as a synonym. However, it
      could also refer to other references (e.g., booking). Without sample
      values, confidence is medium-high.

  - unmappedHeader: REFERENCE
    canonicalField: shipment_reference
    confidence: 0.85
    reasoning: Header 'REFERENCE' is a common synonym for 'shipment_reference'. It
      is not currently listed, but it is a strong semantic match. Sample values
      are empty, but the header name is a strong indicator.

  - unmappedHeader: POD (Secondary)
    canonicalField: pod
    confidence: 0.8
    reasoning: Header 'POD (Secondary)' contains 'POD', which is the primary acronym
      for the canonical field 'pod'. The '(Secondary)' qualifier suggests it
      might be an alternate port, but the core data type (port code) matches. It
      is a reasonable synonym.
